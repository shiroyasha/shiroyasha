## Hey, Iâ€™m Igor ðŸ‘‹

Founder of [Operately](github.com/operately/operately), Software Engineer, and formerly the Lead 
Architect at [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com). My journey in tech has been driven by a passion 
for building tools that simplify complex processes and help people get meaningful work done. Beyond 
the keyboard, Iâ€™m a cat and dog person, a coffee enthusiast, a hiker who enjoys the challenge and 
beaty of nature. I also love writing, whether itâ€™s about technology, personal reflections, or 
lessons learned along the way.

### What Iâ€™m Working On

Right now, my focus is on Operately, a product designed to make team operations clearer and more effective. 

The idea is simple: help teams focus on doing the work, not managing it. Iâ€™m not interested in creating 
tools that distract or complicate. Instead, I aim to build something that integrates seamlessly into 
the daily flow, removing unnecessary steps and keeping teams aligned with minimal effort. Operately 
is about building a work environment where the important things are easy to manage, and everything 
else stays out of the way.

### Elixir and Functional Programming

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to technologies that offer elegance and power, which is why Elixir and 
Erlang have become such an important part of my work. The robustness of the BEAM (Erlang VM) 
and the simplicity of functional programming resonate deeply with my philosophy of building 
software. Elixir, in particular, stands out with its clean syntax and the ability to handle 
concurrency effortlessly. It allows me to build scalable, maintainable applications while staying 
true to the principles of simplicity and clarity. Functional programming, with its emphasis 
on immutability and first-class functions, aligns perfectly with the goal of writing 
predictable, reliable code.

### Remote Work

Having spent years working remotely, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the unique advantages it offers. 
Remote work is about more than just location; itâ€™s about autonomy, trust, and a focus on results 
over hours. It requires clear communication, discipline, and the ability to create a productive
environment wherever you are. I believe remote work is the futureâ€”it empowers people to do 
their best work without the constraints of a traditional office. In my experience, it fosters 
a culture of ownership and accountability, where what matters is the quality of the work 
and the impact it has.

### Rails Testing Handbook

In 2018, I authored the Rails Testing Handbook. This book is a reflection of my experience 
working with Ruby on Rails and my belief in the power of good testing practices. Itâ€™s packed 
with insights on how to write reliable, maintainable tests that help developers ship with 
confidence. Writing the book was a deeply rewarding processâ€”it gave me the chance to organize 
my thoughts and share knowledge that I hope has made a difference for many Rails developers.

### Letâ€™s Talk

Iâ€™m always open to conversations about building meaningful software, sharing insights, or simply 
connecting with others who are passionate about creating things that make a difference. If any of this 
resonates with you, feel free to reach out. Whether itâ€™s a discussion about product development, 
best practices in software engineering, or the art of simplifying the complex, Iâ€™m all ears.
